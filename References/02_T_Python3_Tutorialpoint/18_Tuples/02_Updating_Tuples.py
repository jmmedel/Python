Updating Tuples
Tuples are immutable, which means you cannot update or change the values of tuple elements. You are able to take portions of the existing tuples to create new tuples as the following example demonstrates −"""

tup1 = (12, 34.56)
tup2 = ('abc', 'xyz')

# Following action is not valid for tuples
# tup1[0] = 100;

# So let's create a new tuple as follows
tup3 = tup1 + tup2
print (tup3)
