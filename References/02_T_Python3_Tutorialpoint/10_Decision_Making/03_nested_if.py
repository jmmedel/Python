"""Python 3 - Nested IF Statements
There may be a situation when you want to check for another condition after a condition resolves to true. In such a situation, you can use the nested if construct.

In a nested if construct, you can have an if...elif...else construct inside another if...elif...else construct.

Syntax
The syntax of the nested if...elif...else construct may be −

if expression1:
   statement(s)
   if expression2:
      statement(s)
   elif expression3:
      statement(s)
   else
      statement(s)
elif expression4:
   statement(s)
else:
   statement(s)
Example"""

num = int(input("enter number"))
if num%2 == 0:
   if num%3 == 0:
      print ("Divisible by 3 and 2")
   else:
      print ("divisible by 2 not divisible by 3")
else:
   if num%3 == 0:
      print ("divisible by 3 not divisible by 2")
   else:
      print  ("not Divisible by 2 not divisible by 3")
