# Create a program that takes an IP address entered at the keyboard
# and validates that it can be interpreted as a valid IP address.
#
# An IP address consists of 4 numbers, separated from each other with a full stop.
# Each number can have no more than 3 digits.
# Examples are:
# 127.0.0.1
# 192.168.0.1
# 10.0.12.255
# 172.16.57.1
# 255.255.255.0
#
# If the IP address is valid, print the word "ping " followed by the ip address
# otherwise print a suitable error message - the more information you can provide
# in the message the better.
#
# As an optional extra part to the challenge, restrict each number to be between 0 and 255,
# and do not allow 0.0.0.0 as a valid address.
#
# Once you have a working program, here are some suggestions for invalid input to test:
#
# .123.45.678.91
#  123.4567.8.9
#  123.156.289.10123456
# 10.10t.10.10
# 12.9.34.6.12.90
# '' - that is, press enter without typing anything
#
# This challenge is intended to practise for loops, and if/else statements, so although
# it would probably be written for real using regular expressions we don't want you
# to use them here even if you know what they are.
